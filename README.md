## Who is this website for and what does it do? 

Hangman is an interactive game made using Python. User goal is to guess the word that's randomly chosen from a pre-made list of English words. Each letter in a word is represented with an underscore which is displayed to the User. The user can make a guess six times. For each incorrect guess, a body part is being added to the "hangman". The goal is to guess the word within six tries and not complete the hangman. The game is made for everyone above 12 years of age.
